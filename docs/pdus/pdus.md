title: PDU Management in AUTOSAR ARXML - Packing Signals and Unique Identifiers
description: Manage Protocol Data Units (PDUs) in AUTOSAR ARXML files using EEA COM. Understand the role of PDUs in signal transmission and reception, and explore the unique identifiers associated with each PDU. Utilize the PDUs tab to copy, paste, and create duplicate signals for efficient data handling in your communication architecture.

# PDUs (Protocol Data Units)

PDU contains information other than our data which is used or extracted by below or upper layers in transmission or reception respectively. The PDU is basically a group of packed signals along with lower layer information. AUTOSAR COM performs the packing or unpacking of signals in or from PDU while transmission or reception respectively. Every PDU has a unique identifier associated with it. 
               
The PDUs tab on EEA COM software shows multiple types of PDUs.

Here is  one more thing: we can copy the PDU signals and paste. Also paste signals multiple times we can paste here  and also create the duplicate signals.
